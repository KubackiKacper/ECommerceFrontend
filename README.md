# ECommerce - Frontend
## React + Typescript
### WORK IN PROGRESS

### This is my implemetation of frontend part for my E-Commerce solution. Using React + TypeScript and Bootstrap, I have developed a graphical user interface for my e-commerce solution, displaying available products. All visible elements on the page are JSX components, written in React with precise type definitions using TypeScript.

### The website is fully responsive and dynamically adapts to the user's browser window size. Users can add products to the cart while specifying the quantity. After adding an item, an alert is displayed with relevant information.

### To access the cart view, users can click the icon in the upper-right corner to see its contents.

### The application utilizes local storage, ensuring that products added to the cart remain there even after refreshing the page.
### The project is currently under active development, and all updates will be implemented continuously.
